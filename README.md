# Ignacio Krichevsky Programming Playground

### Running:

Java 18 (or higher) and Maven (3.6.3) or higher must be installed.

1. open a terminal and `cd` to the root directory.
2. enter the command: `mvn test`.

#### Implementation Notes:

1. For many of the problems I've documented that a `not null` input is expected. It's up to the caller to make sure this
   is the case.
2. For simplicity, many of the problems were solved using the `Integer`. `<Generics>` could be used for real code.
